    <h1>Uh oh, a plugin might be failing...</h1>
    <p>
      You might have a plugin that's failing. If you installed any
      custom plugins manually, they may not function correctly with
      this version of DokuWiki. You should look in they
      Grain Log for this grain to examine the errors from PHP-FPM.
      If the issue is in plugin code, you'll have to remove the plugin manually
      from the grain's filestructure via backup and restore.
      You can then try installing a new version of the plugin, or find
      a different one with better compatibility.

    <h2>To fix a plugin issue:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Download a Backup of the grain.</li>
      <li>Unzip the grain archive.</li>
      <li>
        Find the plugin that the error is referring to in
        the <code>data/lib/dokiwiki/lib/plugins</code> folder and remove the
        plugin's folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zip up the unzipped grain archive, taking care to
        preserve the same root files/folders as the original
        Zip file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Restore the grain from backup using the new Zip file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the new grain. If it's working again, great!
        If not, see if the error is still with plugins that
        need removal/upgrading.
      </li>
    </ol>
